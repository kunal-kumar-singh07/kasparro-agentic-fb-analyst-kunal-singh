      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Given the significantly higher ROAS of retargeting audiences, a budget increase is likely to drive a positive impact. Retargeting capitalizes on existing customer interest, making conversions more probable. A 20% budget increase should, proportionally, increase conversions and associated revenue more than other audiences, resulting in the hypothesized ROAS increase. This assumes ad spend is optimized within the retargeting audience.",

      "issue": "Creative Fatigue",
      "hypothesis": "Replacing the bottom 20% performing creatives (based on ROAS) with new creatives that highlight different product features (e.g., emphasizing breathability vs. wire-free) will increase overall campaign ROAS by 10% within two weeks.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Creative fatigue is a common issue. Replacing underperforming creatives addresses this directly. Introducing varied messaging around product features like breathability vs. wire-free provides new angles that can resonate with different segments within the target audience. This refresh can counteract ad blindness and potentially improve click-through and conversion rates, leading to a higher ROAS. The two-week timeframe is reasonable for observing a noticeable change.",

      "issue": "US Market Performance",
      "hypothesis": "Shifting 15% of the budget from IN and UK to the US market will increase overall ROAS by at least 3% without significantly impacting performance in IN and UK.",
      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "While the US market exhibits a higher ROAS, shifting budget requires careful consideration. A 15% budget reduction in IN and UK could potentially decrease their ROAS due to reduced reach and frequency. The hypothesis is partially validated because the potential for increased ROAS in the US is strong, but the assumption of minimal impact in IN and UK needs further scrutiny. The impact also depends on the absolute spend in each region; a small reduction in a low-spend market may have minimal impact, while a large reduction in a high-spend market could be detrimental.",

      "issue": "Broad Audience Optimization",
      "hypothesis": "Implementing interest-based targeting within the broad audience segment, focusing on 'active lifestyle' and 'comfort clothing', will increase the ROAS of the broad audience by at least 15%.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Broad audiences, by definition, lack specific targeting, resulting in lower ROAS. Layering interest-based targeting helps refine the audience and improve ad relevance. Focusing on 'active lifestyle' and 'comfort clothing' aligns with potential customer needs and preferences. This increased relevance should translate to higher engagement and conversion rates, resulting in the hypothesized ROAS increase. The 15% increase target is ambitious but achievable with effective implementation.",

      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Removing low-performing creatives is a fundamental optimization step. Customer testimonials provide social proof and can be highly persuasive, increasing user confidence and purchase likelihood. Replacing underperforming ads with testimonial-focused variations directly addresses the issue of low ROAS. The one-week timeframe is reasonable for observing a positive impact, assuming new ads are launched promptly and gain sufficient impressions. A 7% increase is realistic, assuming the existing low-ROAS ads were significantly dragging down the average.",

      "issue": "Facebook vs. Instagram Performance",
      "hypothesis": "Allocating 10% more budget to Facebook from Instagram will increase overall ROAS by 2%.",
      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "While Facebook has a slightly higher ROAS, a 10% budget shift might not automatically translate to a proportional ROAS increase. Factors such as audience overlap, creative performance differences on each platform, and varying ad formats come into play. It is partially validated as the data shows FB performing better, but the effect needs close monitoring to validate the assumption of an overall ROAS increase and that a shift doesnt adversely affect instagrams ROAS more than expected. The 2% increase is within a possible range, but depends on the nuances of performance on both platforms after the change.",
