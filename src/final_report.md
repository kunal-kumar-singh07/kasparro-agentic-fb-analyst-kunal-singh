# Insights & Recommendations

## 1. Recent ROAS Decline

**Description:** ROAS has been decreasing from 2025-03-24 to 2025-03-31.

**Severity:** Medium

**Confidence:** 0.8

**Recommendation:** Implement a promotion targeting new customers to counteract the recent ROAS decline by driving incremental sales. A promotion targeting new customers addresses the ROAS decline by attempting to expand the customer base and stimulate initial purchases. Could also consider if LTV of new customers makes sense.

## 2. Creative Fatigue on Women's Apparel

**Description:** Several creatives, particularly those for women's apparel like bras and boyshorts, show signs of fatigue with high impressions and declining ROAS.

**Severity:** Medium

**Confidence:** 0.9

**Recommendation:** Replace fatigued creatives for women's bras and boyshorts with new visuals and messaging focused on comfort and support to increase ROAS. The hypothesis directly addresses creative fatigue by introducing fresh visuals and messaging. Focusing on 'comfort and support' responds to potential unmet needs or evolving customer preferences. Messaging should focus on benefits and values that are current and relevant. Testing influencer-created content for women's apparel (bras, boyshorts) will provide fresh creative assets and appeal to a broader audience, mitigating creative fatigue and improving ROAS. Influencer selection has to be relevant to target audience.

## 3. Underperforming Creatives

**Description:** Certain creatives consistently underperform, specifically those using the messaging 'Breathable microfiber that moves with you — limited offer on women panties.' and 'Breathable cotton that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras.'

**Severity:** Medium

**Confidence:** 0.95

**Recommendation:** Pause the underperforming creatives and reallocate their budget to top-performing creatives to improve overall ROAS. This hypothesis is grounded in the fundamental principle of optimizing ad spend. Pausing low-ROAS creatives and redistributing the budget to higher-performing ones ensures efficient resource allocation.

## 4. Retargeting Audience Success

**Description:** The retargeting audience demonstrates a significantly higher ROAS (14.40) compared to broad (8.06) and lookalike (9.66) audiences.

**Severity:** Low

**Confidence:** 0.9

**Recommendation:** Increase budget allocation to retargeting campaigns, combined with dynamically updated creative messaging based on products viewed, to further increase ROAS from this high-performing audience. Dynamic creatives ensures ads are relevant and avoids showing ads for products already purchased.

## 5. US Market Dominance

**Description:** The US market shows a higher ROAS (10.28) compared to IN (8.71) and UK (9.08).

**Severity:** Low

**Confidence:** 0.75

**Recommendation:** Duplicate successful US creatives and ad targeting strategies in the IN and UK markets, with localized messaging and offers, to improve ROAS in those regions. IN and UK consumers might have different needs and preferences than US. Market research into these regional differences is needed to increase likelihood of success.

## 6. Facebook and Instagram Performance

**Description:** Facebook (ROAS: 9.90) performs slightly better than Instagram (ROAS: 9.38).

**Severity:** Low

**Confidence:** 0.8

**Recommendation:** Adjust budget allocation between Facebook and Instagram based on a weekly ROAS analysis to optimize platform performance. This strategy needs to be automated and scalable.

## 7. A/B Testing Underperforming Creatives

**Description:** Evaluate performance of underperforming creatives through A/B testing

**Severity:** Low

**Confidence:** 0.7

**Recommendation:** A/B testing different call-to-actions (e.g., 'Shop Now' vs. 'Learn More') on the underperforming creatives will determine if a simple CTA change can improve their performance. It's important to segment audience to see what resonates better, shop now vs learn more for new vs returning customers.
