## Insights and Recommendations

*   **Recent ROAS Decline:** ROAS has decreased recently. Investigate potential causes such as increased competition or ineffective creatives. Consider bid adjustments or creative refreshes.
*   **Underperforming Creatives:** The following creatives have very low ROAS: "Breathable microfiber that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras.",  "Doctors recommend breathable modal — meet our men athletic briefs." Pause or update these creatives with new copy and visuals. The one with ROAS of 0.67 is particularly egregious and needs immediate action.
*   **Top Performing Creatives:** Scale up spend on the top-performing creative: "Doctors recommend breathable modal — meet our men boxers." Explore similar creatives. 
*   **Creative Fatigue:** Many creatives show signs of fatigue. Refresh ad copy and visuals. A/B test variations.
*   **Retargeting Audience:** The retargeting audience is significantly outperforming other audiences. Reallocate budget to focus on retargeting efforts.
*   **Platform Performance:** Facebook has slightly better ROAS than Instagram. Monitor and adjust spend accordingly.

## Validated Hypotheses & Actions

2.  **Underperforming Creative: Women Sports Bras (Microfiber) (Validated):** Replace the visual with customer testimonials to build trust and increase conversions. *Action: Implement new visuals with testimonials.*
3.  **Underperforming Creative: Men Athletic Briefs (Modal) (Validated):** Shift ad copy to focus on comfort and breathability instead of solely relying on doctor recommendations. *Action: Revise ad copy to emphasize comfort.*
4.  **Top Performing Creative: Men Boxers (Modal) (Partial):** Expand targeting cautiously, A/B test with slightly different creatives instead of just doing straight duplication.
5.  **Creative Fatigue (Partial):** Implement new creative concepts but test performance with a small subset before a full rollout.
6.  **Retargeting Audience Advantage (Partial):** Increase budget allocation to retargeting, but maintain a balance to avoid saturation and limit new customer reach. Consider a 50% allocation initially.
7.  **Platform Performance Differences (Rejected):** Minor difference in ROAS between Facebook and Instagram does not justify a straight budget reallocation. Focus on individual campaigns optimizations.
8.  **Men's Modal Products Performing Well (Partial):** Launch campaign showcasing men's modal comfort. Test creative and expect variation on the average ROAS.
