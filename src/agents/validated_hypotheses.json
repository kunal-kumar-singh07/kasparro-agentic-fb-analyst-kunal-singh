      "hypothesis": "Implementing a promotion targeting new customers will counteract the recent ROAS decline by driving incremental sales.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "A promotion targeting new customers addresses the ROAS decline by attempting to expand the customer base and stimulate initial purchases. New customer acquisition can often have a higher initial ROAS due to pent-up demand or first-time buyer incentives. The absence of identified creative or audience issues further strengthens the argument for a promotional offer to boost demand and compensate for the ROAS dip. This aligns with marketing principles of demand generation and new customer funnel activation. Could also consider if LTV of new customers makes sense.",

      "hypothesis": "Replacing fatigued creatives for women's bras and boyshorts with new visuals and messaging focused on comfort and support will increase ROAS.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The hypothesis directly addresses creative fatigue by introducing fresh visuals and messaging. Focusing on 'comfort and support' responds to potential unmet needs or evolving customer preferences. High impressions with declining ROAS strongly suggest creative fatigue. New creatives focused on key benefits can reinvigorate ad performance, driving click-through rates and conversions. Messaging should focus on benefits and values that are current and relevant.",

      "issue": "Underperforming Creatives",
      "hypothesis": "Pausing the underperforming creatives ('Breathable microfiber that moves with you — limited offer on women panties.' and 'Breathable cotton that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras.') and reallocating their budget to top-performing creatives will improve overall ROAS.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "This hypothesis is grounded in the fundamental principle of optimizing ad spend. Pausing low-ROAS creatives and redistributing the budget to higher-performing ones ensures efficient resource allocation. This directly increases the overall average ROAS by eliminating inefficient spending. This is a core tenant of marketing spend management and optimisation.",

      "issue": "Retargeting Audience Success",
      "hypothesis": "Increasing budget allocation to retargeting campaigns, combined with dynamically updated creative messaging based on products viewed, will further increase ROAS from this high-performing audience.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The hypothesis leverages the already high-performing retargeting audience. By increasing budget and implementing dynamic creative personalization based on viewed products, the relevance and effectiveness of the ads are enhanced. This improves the likelihood of conversion. Retargeting is effective due to increased brand recall and addressing specific user intent. Dynamic creatives ensures ads are relevant and avoids showing ads for products already purchased.",

      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "While leveraging successful strategies across markets is sound, the hypothesis requires localization. Simply duplicating creatives may not account for cultural nuances, language differences, or market-specific preferences. Localization should encompass not just language, but also imagery, pricing, and promotional offers tailored to each region. IN and UK consumers might have different needs and preferences than US. Market research into these regional differences is needed to increase likelihood of success.",

      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "This is a sound optimization strategy. Weekly ROAS analysis provides timely insights into platform performance. Adjusting budget allocation dynamically allows for maximizing ad spend on the more effective platform. This also aligns with the principle of continuous testing and iterative improvement, fundamental to marketing optimization. This strategy needs to be automated and scalable.",

      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Influencer content offers a fresh perspective and authenticity, potentially resonating strongly with target audiences. This strategy leverages the trust and credibility of influencers to combat creative fatigue. By tapping into influencer networks, the brand can reach a wider audience and drive engagement. Influencer selection has to be relevant to target audience.",

      "issue": "Underperforming Creatives",
      "hypothesis": "A/B testing different call-to-actions (e.g., 'Shop Now' vs. 'Learn More') on the underperforming creatives will determine if a simple CTA change can improve their performance.",
      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "While CTA optimization is valuable, it might not be the sole driver of improvement for significantly underperforming creatives. A/B testing CTAs is a good starting point, but deeper issues related to targeting, product-market fit, or overall creative messaging might need to be addressed if initial tests don't yield substantial results. This is a good low-effort strategy. It's important to segment audience to see what resonates better, shop now vs learn more for new vs returning customers.",
