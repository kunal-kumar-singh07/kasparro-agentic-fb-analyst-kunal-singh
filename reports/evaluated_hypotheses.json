      "hypothesis": "Creatives with declining CTR and ROAS are suffering from creative fatigue, causing them to be less effective in attracting and converting users.",
      "quantitative_support": "The 'creative_fatigue_signals' section explicitly lists creatives with declining CTR and high impressions, indicating fatigue. For example, 'Breathable bamboo that moves with you — limited offer on men briefs' has a CTR of 0.00847 and 953964 impressions, with a ROAS of 9.49. This combination of high impressions and low CTR/ROAS supports the hypothesis. The difference between the best and worst creatives also supports this hypothesis.",

      "quantitative_support": "The 'worst_creatives' section shows creatives with very low ROAS. For example, 'Breathable modal that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras' has a ROAS of only 0.67. Comparing the messaging of these underperforming creatives with the 'top_creatives' reveals potential differences in effectiveness. The overall CTR also seems to be impacting ROAS, as the worst creatives often have lower CTRs.",

      "quantitative_support": "The 'top_creatives' section shows creatives with significantly high ROAS. For example, 'Doctors recommend breathable modal — meet our women bras' has a ROAS of 1381.74. The common theme of 'Doctors recommend breathable...' across multiple top creatives suggests a compelling and effective message. The highest ROAS creatives often have the highest CTR as well, indicating a successful match with audience preferences.",
