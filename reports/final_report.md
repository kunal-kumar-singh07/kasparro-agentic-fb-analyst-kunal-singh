| ROAS Decline         | The drop in ROAS is caused by creative fatigue, leading to decreased CTR and conversion rates.        | The overall ROAS is 5.83, but daily ROAS fluctuates significantly. The presence of 'creative\_fatigue\_signals' supports this hypothesis, showing specific creatives with high impression counts but declining CTR and ROAS.                                                                                                                                                | 0.8            | 0.9        |
| Creative Fatigue       | Creatives with declining CTR and ROAS are suffering from creative fatigue.                               | The 'creative\_fatigue\_signals' section lists creatives with declining CTR and high impressions. For example, 'Breathable bamboo that moves with you — limited offer on men briefs' has a CTR of 0.00847 and 953964 impressions.

| Top Creatives          | Top performing creatives are successful due to compelling messaging and alignment with audience preferences. | The 'top\_creatives' section shows creatives with significantly high ROAS. For example, 'Doctors recommend breathable modal — meet our women bras' has a ROAS of 1381.74. The common theme of 'Doctors recommend breathable...' across multiple top creatives suggests a compelling and effective message.
