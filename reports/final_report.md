## Marketing Analysis Report: ROAS Decline and Creative Fatigue

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Executive Summary:**

This report analyzes a recent decline in Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and identifies potential creative fatigue across our advertising campaigns. Overall ROAS is 5.83. Data shows significant ROAS fluctuations, with a recent decrease possibly linked to ad creative fatigue. There's a considerable performance disparity between our top and worst-performing creatives. The report provides actionable recommendations to refresh ad creatives and improve campaign performance.

**1. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Summary:**

| Metric         | Value           |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Total Spend    | $2,105,579.90   |
| Total Revenue  | $12,265,700.72  |
| Overall ROAS   | 5.83            |
| Overall CTR    | 1.26%          |
| Overall CPC    | $14.95          |
| Overall CPM    | $3.11           |

**2. Problem Identification: ROAS Decline**

A decreasing ROAS trend has been observed from January to March. While the overall ROAS is 5.83, daily ROAS values fluctuated significantly and have trended downwards more recently, especially in late February and March.

**3. Problem Identification: Creative Fatigue**

Several creatives are exhibiting signs of fatigue: declining Click-Through Rates (CTR) and ROAS despite a large number of impressions.

**4. Data Analysis & Insights:**

*   **ROAS Trend:** The overall ROAS for the reporting period is positive, but a noticeable downward trend exists, particularly in recent weeks. This suggests that our advertising efficiency is decreasing.
*   **Creative Performance Disparity:** A significant performance gap exists between our best and worst-performing creatives. Top creatives have ROAS values exceeding 500x, while the worst performing ads barely return 1x ROAS, indicating messaging issues or targeting mismatch.
*   **Creative Fatigue Indicators:** Some creatives with high impression counts display low CTR and declining ROAS, pointing to creative fatigue. For instance, the creative "Breathable microfiber that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras." has many impressions (840524) but only yields a ROAS of 1.66 and a CTR of .008.

| ROAS Decline              | Increased competition in the ad auction is driving up costs and lowering returns.                                                           | 0.4            | 0.4       | Decreasing ROAS trend present.

| ROAS Decline              | Changes in the target audience's preferences or behaviors are contributing to the decline in ROAS.                                          | 0.2            | 0.2       | Fluctuating ROAS. Lacking audience demographic data to confirm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Creative Fatigue           | Ad fatigue is causing the ROAS decline, as users are becoming desensitized to existing creatives.                                            | 0.7            | 0.8       | `creative_fatigue_signals` data supports this. Creatives such as 'Breathable microfiber that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras.' have high impression counts (840524) but a low ROAS (1.66) and CTR (0.00836). Also, ROAS shows a decreasing trend from January to March, adding evidence of fatigue.                                                                                |
| Creative Performance Disparity | Some ad strategies or messaging resonates better with the target audience than others, leading to the gap between top and bottom creatives. | 0.9            | 0.9       | Large ROAS difference (1381.74 vs. 0.67) between best and worst performing creatives and varying CTRs across different creatives strongly supports this hypothesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Creative Performance Disparity | The poor-performing creatives have underlying issues such as a misleading or irrelevant message, causing the low ROAS.                                    | 0.7            | 0.8       | Worst performing creatives have low ROAS and relatively low CTRs. "Breathable microfiber that moves with you — limited offer on women sports bras." has a CTR of 0.00836 and ROAS of 1.66. Low CTR suggests users don't connect with message.  Relevancy cannot be determined.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
