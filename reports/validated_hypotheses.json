A decreasing CTR would naturally lead to a decrease in conversion rates, which in turn reduces ROAS. Further analysis should focus on the age and impression count of the underperforming creatives to confirm fatigue.",

      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "This hypothesis is well-supported by the provided signals. Lower CTR and ROAS values for specific creatives, combined with high impression counts, are classic indicators of creative fatigue. Investigating the performance timeline for these creatives will provide more conclusive evidence. Consider segmenting performance by demographics or platform to further refine insights.",

      "strengthened_reasoning": "While low ROAS indicates underperformance, the hypothesis needs stronger validation regarding the *reason* for this underperformance. The 'potential issues' and 'potential mismatch' signals are speculative. To strengthen this, you need data demonstrating mismatched targeting or audience feedback indicating issues with messaging/visuals (e.g., A/B test results, user reviews). The hypothesis is plausible but lacks concrete supporting evidence.",

      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "High ROAS values certainly suggest success. However, stating the reason as 'compelling messaging and alignment with audience preferences' requires more data. While the example messaging is provided, confirmation that it is a *key* factor (e.g., through A/B testing that isolates the messaging variable) and evidence of *why* the audience responds positively (e.g., survey data, social listening) would strengthen this hypothesis. The hypothesis should also acknowledge other contributing factors such as strong calls to action, optimal bidding strategies and relevant landing pages",
