      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The hypothesis is plausible, especially if there have been new entrants or increased ad spend from existing competitors. It would be strengthened by data showing increased CPC or CPM without a corresponding lift in conversion rates. Analyzing auction insights could provide more information.",

    {
      "issue": "ROAS Decline",
      "hypothesis": "Changes in the target audience's preferences or purchasing power are contributing to the decreased ROAS.",
      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "This is a valid consideration as shifts in consumer behavior can significantly impact advertising effectiveness. However, it lacks specificity. Investigating market research data, industry trends, and customer surveys could provide more concrete evidence. Also, analyze if the offer aligns with current consumer needs and preferences.",

    {
      "issue": "Creative Fatigue",
      "hypothesis": "The current creatives have been shown to the target audience for too long, resulting in ad blindness and reduced engagement, leading to a decrease in CTR and ROAS.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The hypothesis is well-supported by the signals. Declining CTR and ROAS for high-impression creatives strongly suggest creative fatigue. A refresh of creatives is warranted.",

      "issue": "Underperforming Creatives",
      "hypothesis": "The messaging and visuals in the underperforming creatives are not resonating with the target audience, resulting in low ROAS.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Extremely low ROAS, particularly when compared to the average, directly points to a problem with the creative elements. A/B testing different messaging and visuals should be prioritized.",
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "issue": "Underperforming Creatives",
      "hypothesis": "The offer (limited offer, discounts etc) in the underperforming creatives is not attractive enough for the target audience, resulting in low ROAS.",
      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "This is a reasonable hypothesis if specific creatives with offers are underperforming. Analyze offer redemption rates and compare them to historical data. It could be strengthened by comparing the performance of different offers.",
