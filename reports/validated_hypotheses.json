      "strengthened_reasoning": "The very low ROAS and CTR for the 'Breathable microfiber' creative strongly indicate that this specific creative is not resonating with the target audience, either due to ad fatigue from repeated exposure or an inherent disconnect between the creative's message and the audience's needs or preferences. A mismatch in targeting could also contribute to the low performance.",

      "strengthened_reasoning": "The stark contrast in performance metrics (ROAS and CTR) between the best and worst-performing creatives emphasizes the critical need for a data-driven approach. By focusing resources on the themes and elements that drive the highest engagement and conversion, and eliminating those that consistently underperform, it is possible to improve overall campaign effectiveness and ROAS. This also highlights the importance of ongoing A/B testing and creative iteration.",
