      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "While decreasing ROAS can be an indicator, it's crucial to analyze CPM/CPC trends to confirm increased competition. Market conditions should include specific competitive data (e.g., new entrants, competitor spending). A higher confidence level would be justified with supporting CPM/CPC data. The hypothesis is plausible, but further data is needed to validate.",

      "issue": "ROAS Decline",
      "hypothesis": "Changes in the target audience's preferences or behaviors are contributing to the decline in ROAS.",
      "status": "partial",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "Decreasing ROAS is a symptom, not definitive proof. Audience demographics data should also include behavioral data or preference shifts based on surveys or market research. This is plausible, but needs data linking ROAS decline to specific audience changes.",

      "issue": "Creative Fatigue",
      "hypothesis": "Ad fatigue is causing the ROAS decline, as users are becoming desensitized to existing creatives.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The supporting signals provide a solid basis for this hypothesis. Decreasing ROAS, declining CTR for specific creatives, and high impression counts for fatigued creatives all consistently point toward creative fatigue.",

    {
      "issue": "Creative Performance Disparity",
      "hypothesis": "The large gap in performance between top and bottom creatives indicates that some ad strategies or messaging resonates better with the target audience than others.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The provided signals directly support this hypothesis. A significant ROAS difference between best and worst creatives, combined with varying CTRs, strongly suggests that certain approaches are more effective.",

    {
      "issue": "Creative Performance Disparity",
      "hypothesis": "The poor-performing creatives have underlying issues such as a misleading or irrelevant message, causing the low ROAS.",
      "status": "validated",
      "strengthened_reasoning": "The provided signals suggest this is likely true. ROAS disparity and low CTR on worst-performing creatives align with the idea of flawed messaging. While other factors could contribute, the available data supports the hypothesis.",
